# Step by step on setting up NKG

- Download the files [here](https://github.com/NarwhalKidGames/NarwhalKidGames/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) (the final size is ~1.93 GB).

- Once they finish downloading, click on the `NarwhalKidGames-main` file a single time.

- Right click the `NarwhalKidGames-main` file and click `Extract All...` (the extraction starts out slow but gets much faster at the end).

- Once it's finished extracting, you can delete the `NarwhalKidGames-main` file with the icon that has the zipper on it. It should also say `Compressed (zipped) Folder` in the `type` section.

- Open the `NarwhalKidGames-main` folder you didn't delete.

- Double click the `! START.bat` file (you may need to click `More info` and `Run anyway` the first time).

- You're done! It should automatically open the website. If not, go to `localhost:3000`.

Note: If you ever want to close the website, open the `! END.bat` file.

Note 2: You will need to open the `! START.bat` file every time you restart your computer.
